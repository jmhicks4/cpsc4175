### Roman Strategy Game
#### By James Hicks and ?
Purpose :
The purpose of this software is to create a game where the players will be able to play as a Roman army going through various battle scenarios against the Gauls
Scope :
The Roman Strategy Game will allow players to move and attack with their armies and if victorious they will be able to recruit new troops and face increasingly difficult scenarios.
They will also be able to save their progress to a username that will require a password
System Features : 
The product will require the player to be able to enter a username and password of the player so that it can load there most recent save data. It will require the ability to sign up for a new account just in case they don't have one. The map page will require a button to save the users progress, open up the recruitment page, and select a level. Then the recruitment page will require a system for players to buy new units and fill up the units the user currently has. Finally there must be a page where the user will go to battle, the player must be able to move and attack with his units and the enemy units must be able to respond accordingly.
External Requirements :
The project will require atleast five User Intefaces so that the player can login or sign up and play the game. It will also require a database to store the user's username and password along with their save data.
