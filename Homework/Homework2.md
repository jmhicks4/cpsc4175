## Homework 2
### By James Hicks
1. The first step that a software engineer needs to do in order to create a program is determine what the clients problem is. Without knowing what the clients problem is
you cannot hope to accurately fix their problem.

2. What the client needs may not be whats best for them as compared to discovering what the software should do. The client will not always no what the actual problem is so
you need to determine what the software needs to do so that you can fix the problem.

3. They are more of a generalist due to the fact that they will need to develop software for a large variety of fields. Therefore in order to create the software that the 
client will require they must at least know something about the field that the software will be used for.

4. Questionnaire : A flaw that I can see coming from this style of determining requirements would be followup questions. While you are in an interview you can ask the client
to clarify or elaborate on something but during a questionnare you cannot.
Forms : If someone were to follow the clients forms they could lose creating some flexibility with the software. Just because the forms give you the basic uses of this 
software does not mean that there will not be rare instances that will require the software to do something beyond the normal use of it.
Direct Observation : You won't know if the people being observed will be doing things how they are normally done. Some of the people may have their own method of dealing with
a problem and some may act differently when they know they are being observed.

5. Requirements are dynamic due to the fact that they will usely change over the course of the project. For example the client might decide that they want to change the
requirement so that it can be able to do something they didn't think about before or the team of software engineers may think of a way to improve this requirement.

6. Functional requirements are parts of the software that must be implemented in order for the software to be able to do what the client needs. Nonfunctional requirements are
parts of the software that can improve the software but are not required for the software to function. Nonfunctional requirements exist, but aren't what I would consider to be
requirements due to the fact that the software will be able to do what it needs to do without them.

7. Top-down analysis is observing the many different parts of the problem in order to create the required software. In case study in the book they focus on creating a diagram 
that details what the users will likely be doing when they use the software, so that they can create a software that will be able to meet those requirements.

8. Due to the fact that you will push the prototype forward even if there are some major issues with it, it could lead to the client losing faith in your ability to create the
software (if it really bad multiple times). The numerous bugs could also lead to inconclusive feedback that doesn't help improve the software by much.

9. I would say that team 2 is doing a better job than team 1. From my perspective team 2 seems to be engaging with the client more and thinking of ways to improve the software
. Whereas Team 1 seems to be sticking to the intitial requirements they were given and not constantly interacting with the client.

10. If you don't properly find out the requirements for the software it will be very hard to implement a software that will be able to meet those requirements. For example
if you were to make a piece of software for a banking website and you just decided to listen to the base requirements you might have some scenarios that will come up
that you didn't think of before, but if you had done a better job of finding out the requirements you could have avoided those issues.
