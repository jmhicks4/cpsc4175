OOAD tends to be more abstract whereas topdown seems to focus on certain problems before implementing them.

3. This article focuses on a new way to teach students about solving a software problem. Throughout the article he uses the example of creating a chess game through programming. He then proceeds to refine that program more and more despite having a working solution available to him. The lesson from this article is that you should focus on trying to find the most refined way of solving a problem, instead of focusing on solving the problem with the most immediate solution.

4. An example of due diligence would be a company testing out a new technique for shipping goods before they make the standard company wide. If they test it before they implement it they can discover the benefits and costs of the system before it hits other stores.
