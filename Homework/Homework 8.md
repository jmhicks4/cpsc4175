## Homework 8
## By James Hicks
1. That the chapter will go on to explain why the Unified Process is a methodology. It will focus on discussing the idea of the Unified Process as a methodology and bring up points to support its claim. If I originally thought that the Unified Process was a methodology I would see this chapter as reassurance of my beliefs.

2. Yes this is a true statement since you are going through each step in the paradigm in order to complete it. With larger programs the object oriented paradigm is similiar to the spiral process because you would be using the paradigm throughout the project until you have covered everything. In the large scale no, in the small scale it is dependant on the complexity of the program.

3. The requirements workflow, during this workflow you will focus on discovering the client's requirements for this software. The analysis workflow, where you look at the requirements and attempt to organize them and think of how to best implement them. The design workflow, prepare the requirements for implementation by deciding how to implement them. The implementation workflow, implement the requirements that your client wanted into the computer language of preference. The test workflow, begin testing your implementation and fix any issues you find.

4. The software project management plan determines what the software development process will be since it is the plan that the software developers will try to follow. No there will always be some kind of process that the project will have to follow, whether it be a known process or a new one. Without a planned process to follow the development cycle will become chaotic.

5. The test workflow tends to focus on how to best test your code whereas the artifact testing tends to focus on creating tracebility in your code so that you can have your code traceable early on in the code. I kind of think that this is an inconsistency in the book because it doesn't emphasize the traceablity of your code until it starts covering the artifacts.

6. I agree with the book in this case, while you won't have as developed of a plan as you will when you begin the implementation of the project at the beginning, you should have some idea of how you are going to handle maintenance after you have finished the project. You would plan the post maintenance after either during your desing phase or during your testing phase.

7. I don't think that the spiral method is part of the unified process, I think that they are arguably the same thing except that the unified process has split the 4 phases into 5 workflows and without the repeating.

8. I think that they would likely look the same except that the spiral case would circle back around whereas I feel like the unified process was a more final process.

9. Software improvement is working on your current software and working towards improving it, software process improvement is working on improve the way you process your software. If you can improve the way you process your software you could theoretically improve all of your software, which makes it very important for all software engineers.
