## Homework 9
## By James Hicks
1. I believe its a mixture of both. Human error can lead to unforseen problems escpecially during the implementation phase and the testing phase. This can lead to people having to change their plans for the software development process depending on what human error happened. Changing requirements can also mess with the flow of software development, you could be working towards finishing the project only to find out that you need an additional requirement added leading to you having to redo some of the software steps.

2. In order to follow the waterfall method of software development you must go back to the previous steps in the code to find the problem and solve it. Whereas with the evolution tree model you are much more flexible than before allowing to follow the steps as you see fit.

3. I can think of an example where i was making a game. I decided to try to fit a lot of mechanics that probably weren't neccasary and nearly led to me not be able to finish it within the time period allowed. At one point I had to sit back and decide which mechanics were the most important parts of my game and focus on making sure those worked before trying to add any of the additional mechanics that I wanted. I suceeded in finishing the base game that I had planned and adding some of the mechanics.

4. The requirements workflow should happen every iteration because the requirements will likely evolve as you make the software. This may be due to the client wanting different requirements or due to the fact that something in the design and/or implementation phase changed one of the requirements that you currently have. Therefore you should always check to make sure you have the proper requirements before each iteration. Testing shouldn't begin until iteration 2 unless you have enough code to reasonably test.

5. That the incrmentation model is focused on dividing your project into smaller chunks and with each incrementation you focus on adapting to what you did in the previous increments.

6. According to the waterfall technique this is what you should do to, I don't personally think that this is the best solution though. If you don't think you need to change your documentation you should move on to the next iteration of the design phase and work from there. If this statement were true I would focus on putting more time into the documentation with each phase instead of focusing on the design and implementation.

7. I guess the closest model that I would be comfortable with would be the code and fix life cycle, with some minor changes. I would have a documentation and design phase, but after the first iteration I wouldn't change them unless I thought that I needed to.

8. This paper has given me more of an idea of how helpful higher math can be for programming. It focuses on the sections of advanced math that can pertain to programming such as conditional statements and the use of functions. If I were to improve my understanding of this material I could apply it to my programming style to improve my programming.
